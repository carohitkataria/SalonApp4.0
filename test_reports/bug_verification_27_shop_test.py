"""
Focused verification script for iteration 27 shop empty-state bug.

Manual/browser execution was performed with Playwright MCP against:
https://meta-inbound-chat.preview.emergentagent.com

Checks covered:
1. Salon store products API returns total=0/products=[] when no supplier-created products exist.
2. /salon/dashboard?tab=shop renders [data-testid="shop-empty-state"] with
   "No products added yet" and without "No products found." or "Coming soon".
3. A product created through the supplier authenticated product API appears in
   the salon Shop UI, then is soft-deleted and the empty state returns.
